Hi, I'm Buloze, welcome to my project site, on here are some of the web apps I've 
developed so far with many more to come as I continue learning to
improve on my Python skills, all these applications are projects 
I build in my journey to learning and improving on skills as a programmer, 
I had fun building these projects because a lot of them really challenged me
on my skills as a programmer. I hope you enjoy.
